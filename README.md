# Honeycomb

[Demo video](https://vimeo.com/107497401)
[App overview](https://github.com/kenanokeefe/Honeycomb3D/wiki)

This repository was an attempt to build a browser-based 3D modeling application intended to output WebGL meshes to STL files for desktop 3D printing. Honeycomb was run as a startup company via the 1776 startup campus based in Washington DC. 

This application would not have been possible without the following open-source projects:
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [Angular](https://github.com/angular)
* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [ThreeCSG](https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG)

This project was inspired by other open-source 3D modeling projects including:
* [Shapesmith](https://github.com/bjnortier/shapesmith)
* [Openscad](https://github.com/openscad/openscad)
* [OpenJSCAD](https://github.com/Spiritdude/OpenJSCAD.org)

Also a big special thanks to [Printrbot](http://printrbot.com/) in supporting this project.
